# Syndikaatti parking

This repository contains the submission for IoThon 2019. The idea of this project is to reduce the amount of time spent looking for a parking spot on Aalto University campus by displaying the available parking spots on an interactive map. It uses a proximity sensor, which sends the data to the cloud upon detecting a car moving in or out of a spot. The project is based on the [given IoThon repository](https://github.com/iothon/docker-compose-mqtt-influxdb-grafana). We implemented the code for the dockerized flask app, the REST API and the code to extract the data from the sensors with Arduino.
